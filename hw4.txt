Q.1) When the depth is 1, the decision tree finds the best split on column 4(numbering the column starts from 1). When the depth is 2, and if the first split is at column 4, we select column 6 for splitting the data again. Else, we find column 5 if column 4 is false. 

If column 4 is false and column 5 true, the tree predicts B
If column 4 is false and column 5 false, the tree predicts B
If column 4 is true and column 6 true, the tree predicts B
If column 4 is true and column 6 false, the tree predicts A

Output from Console:
Depth - 1, Best split - 4
Depth - 2, Best split - 5 & 6
Column 4 true and column 6 true: B with count = 9
Column 4 true and column 6 false: A with count = 40
Column 4 false and column 5 false: B with count = 26
Column 4 false and column 5 true: B with count = 90

Q.2)
a) Error rate of the first stump: 0.18
b) Hypothesis weight of the first stump: 1.5163474893
c) Initial weights for each example: 1/200
d) New weights for each example that was incorrectly classified: 0.005
   New weights for each example that was correctly classified:0.01097
