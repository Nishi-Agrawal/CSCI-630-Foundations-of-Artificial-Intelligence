The program will simply ask for the name of the training data file, if you want a decision tree implementation or adaboost implementation. Once you enter these things, it will implement the decision tree or adaboost accordingly. Then you will be asked for the name of the file you want to output the serialised object to. Once this is done, it will write the current object into an output file. Lastly, the program will ask you for the testing data file name and once that is given, according to the previously mentioned type(decision tree or adaboost), it will use that algorithm predict the result. The output will be printed as follows: for each line in the testing data, it will predict the language in which it was written i.e. 'en' means English and 'nl' means Dutch.
